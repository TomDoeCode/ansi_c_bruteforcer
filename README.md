For simple illustration I have defined a charset of “a...z0...9”.

You can also store capital letters and special characters here. Or refer to an external list. 

The password is then cracked with Brutforce. The code is simple and is mainly for illustration purposes. Bruteforced attacks are not really useful as they take a considerable amount of time. In addition, modern passwords are secured with hashes...

Nevertheless - have fun testing and feel free to give me tips.
